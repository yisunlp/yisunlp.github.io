Hi, I am Yi Su (苏仪), a second-year graduate student supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Juntao Li](https://lijuntaopku.github.io) and Prof. [Min Zhang](https://zhangminsuda.github.io/cn_homepage/News/) at Soochow University.

Before this, I received my Bachelor’s degree (2019-2023, computer science) from Soochow University.

At present, I am working as a kuai star intern at [Kwai](https://www.kuaishou.com/).

My research interest includes Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM).
> The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
