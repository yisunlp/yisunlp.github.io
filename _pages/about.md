Hi, I am Yi Su (苏仪), a second-year graduate student supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Juntao Li](https://lijuntaopku.github.io) and Prof. [Min Zhang](https://zhangminsuda.github.io/cn_homepage/News/) at Soochow University.

Before this, I received my Bachelor’s degree (2019-2023, computer science) from Soochow University.

At present, I am working as a research intern at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ailab.tencent.com/ailab/zh/index) under the mentorship of [Dian Yu](https://sites.google.com/site/yudiandoris/) and [Zhaopeng Tu](https://tuzhaopeng.github.io).

My research interest includes Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM). I am committed to constructing high-performance and efficient deployment algorithms for LLMs, exploring more economical and convenient applications of LLMs in various fields.
> The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
